# Blog Post 2 **Milky Way Galaxy**
## In my trip to the Milky Way Galaxy, I was able to uncover many new findings. We remapped the most efficient path of travel through the Galaxy which is huge for us Earth beings. This new efficient path will allow us to save time and energy while zipping through the Milky Way. This way we can use these saved resources in further exploring other galxies in hopes of finding new knowledge and secrets of the univers! I will be posting a poscast with more details on my trip so stay tuned!!!
